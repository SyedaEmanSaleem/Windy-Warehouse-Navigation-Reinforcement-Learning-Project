# **Windy Warehouse Navigation**

A **Reinforcement Learning (RL) project** where an autonomous agent learns to pick up packages and deliver them safely in a **virtual warehouse** while avoiding moving obstacles and random wind disturbances.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to simulate a warehouse environment where an autonomous agent learns to navigate efficiently using **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**. The agent must pick up packages and deliver them safely while adapting to **dynamic obstacles and wind effects**.

## **Features**

* Autonomous agent navigation using **DQN**
* Handles **dynamic obstacles** and **random wind disturbances**
* Achieves an **average reward of ~27** and **success rate of 82–86%**
* Includes **training graphs, performance metrics, and evaluation video**
* Demonstrates **reinforcement learning in a simulated environment**

## **Tech Stack**

* Python
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenAI Gym


## **Usage**

Run the main script to train the agent and view results:

```bash
Windy_Warehouse_DQN.ipynb
```

* Training graphs and performance metrics will be generated.
* Evaluation video shows the agent navigating the warehouse.

## **Results**

* Average Reward: ~27
* Success Rate: 82–86%
* Agent efficiently picks and delivers packages while avoiding obstacles
